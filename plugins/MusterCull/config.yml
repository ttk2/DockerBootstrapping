#     Priority 2 - High value persistent mobs (horses, villagers).
#       Golems specifically not added as they can be auto'ed leading to an unfortunate culling scenario.

# For the hard cap culling using priority culling strategy, what is the percent

#   chunk in order to get the mob-counts in this chunk back to the average mob-per-chunk
#   serverwide.
#
# Setting this value too high (disabling it in essence) will allow players to cause global cullings by 
#   by having high priority mobs (named/leash/horses) in large densities in their own chunks without
#   a problem.  By setting this to a reasonably percent, these player chunks would be first targeted
#   by a culling in order to bring them down to the average mob-per-chunk value.
#
# NOTE:  a value of 100 = 100%, a value of 15 = 15%, etc.
